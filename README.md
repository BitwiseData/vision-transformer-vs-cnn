# Deep-Learning
Vision Transformers vs. Convolutional Neural Networks
We have the `requirements.txt` file which  contains all Python libraries that our notebook depends on, and they will be installed using:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


There are two python files.The first one is the train.py and second one is test.py.

The train.py contains code starting from data preprocessing, model designing, training and evaluation. 

On the other hand test.py contains the code which takes the already saved best model and evaluates it on the dataset it is trained on previously.

I've also included colab.ipynb notebook.you can run both the train and test files.

Inside the Trained Models folder, there are 6 pre-trained models, three of which are the CNN models and other three are vision transformer models.

I have added comments in the code as well for understanding.
